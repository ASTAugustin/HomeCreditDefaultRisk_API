# HomeCreditDefaultRisk_API

This repository contains mainly two parts:
1. Algo contains the algorithms of prediction 
2. API focus on the implementation of API

## Algo

(*Waiting for description*)

## API

API cantains an ipython file, which can create a basic API of HomeCreditDefaultRisk. You need to pay attention to the fact that you need to have all input csv in a folder named input. I do not push all .csv files to this repository. Dockerfile and app.py are all implemented. To learn more about how I implement them, please turn to the tutorial folder.

I also give a test case. You can use it in Postman to test and use this API from outside.

I will surely put our final image on DockerHub. I hope we can create a wonderful API. 

## 会议总结

1. EDA 部分需要重新讨论
2. Transformer 进行了优化
3. Docker 部分取消，直接做一个本地的 API
